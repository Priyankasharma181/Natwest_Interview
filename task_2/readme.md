## question
```python
 S = {1, 7, 4} 
 k = 3.
```

## simple output
```python
3
```

1. First of all I created a function is **nonDivisiblesubset** .

2. In which I passed two argument s and k. s is list and k is divisior.

4. Here i used some funtions.

```
max()
    I used max() function that will give maximum element in list.
```

```
append()
       It is function that adds a element to list.
```
5. I find out frequency of divisor by this formula 

```
frequncy[i%k]+=1 a
```
and returned the maxvalue to output.
