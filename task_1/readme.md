# Counting of tallest candels.
```python
sample input
4
3213
```

1. First of all  with the  help of user input I created a list according to user input.

2.  I created a function birthdayCakeCandles.
```python
 def 
 It is keyword which is used to create function.
```

3.   I also used max() function.   
```python 
max() 
    It is  a function that I used to figure out the tallest candle.
```
4. I took a variable count for counting  tallest candles.

 ```python
I used for loop to  Iterate over the list.
```
5. After over all I compare each element to maxHeight if that condition is satisfied then it will increase count by one.

6. In the last it will return counting of tallest candles to output.
